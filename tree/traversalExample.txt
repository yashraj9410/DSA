Preorder Traversal:

Visit the current node.
Recursively traverse the left subtree.
Recursively traverse the right subtree.
In the example tree, the preorder traversal would be: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3].


Inorder Traversal:

Recursively traverse the left subtree.
Visit the current node.
Recursively traverse the right subtree.
In the example tree, the inorder traversal would be: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3].


Postorder Traversal:

Recursively traverse the left subtree.
Recursively traverse the right subtree.
Visit the current node.
In the example tree, the postorder traversal would be: [4, 5, 2, 3, 1].
